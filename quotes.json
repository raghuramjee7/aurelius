["The Meditations  by Marcus Aurelius ", "", "BOOK ONE", "From my grandfather Verus I lear ned good morals and the government of my temper. ", "From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. ", "From my mother, piety and benefice nce, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil t houghts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.", "From my great-grandfather, not to  have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home,  and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally. ", "From my governor, to be neither of  the green nor of the blue party at the games in the Circus, nor a partizan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius at the gladiators ' fights; from him too I learned endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people 's affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander. ", "From Diognetus, not to busy myself about trifling things, and not to give credit to what was said by miracle-workers and jugglers about incantations and the driving away of daemons and such things; and not to breed quails for fighting, nor  to give myself up passionately to such things; and to endure freedom of speech; and to have become intimate with philosophy; and to have  been a hearer, first of Bacchius, then of Tandasis and Marcianus; and to have written dialogues in my youth; and to have desired a plank bed and skin, and whatever else of the kind belongs to th e Grecian discipline. ", "From Rusticus I received the impression that my character required improvement and discipline; and from him I learned not to be led astray to sophistic emulation, nor to wr iting on speculative matters, nor to delivering little hortatory orat ions, nor to showing myself off as a man who practises much disc ipline, or does benevolent acts in order to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine writing; and not to walk  about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other things of the kind; and to write my letters ", "with simplicity, like the letter which Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa to my mother; and with respect to those who have offended me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed  to be pacified and reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readin ess to be reconciled; and to read carefully, and not to be satisfied  with a superfic ial understanding of a book; nor hastily to give my a ssent to those who talk overmuch; and I am indebted to him for being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, which he communicated  to me out of his own collection.", "From Apollonius I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except to reason; and to be always the sa me, in sharp pains, on the occasion of the loss of a child, and in long illness; and to see clearly in a living example that the same man can be both most  resolute and yielding, and not peevish in giving his inst ruction; and to have had before my eyes a man who clearly considered his experience and his skill in expounding philosophical principles as the smallest of his merits; and from him I learned how to receiv e from friends what are esteemed favours, without being either humbled by them or letting them pass unnoticed. ", "From Sextus, a benevolent disposit ion, and the example of a family governed in a fatherly manner, a nd the idea of living conformably to nature; and gravity without a ffectation, and to look carefully after the interests of friends, a nd to tolerate ignorant persons, and those who form opinions without consideration: he had the power of readily accommodating himself to all, so that intercourse with him was more agreeable than any fl attery; and at the same time he was most highly venerated by those w ho associated with him: and he had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in an intelligent and methodical way, the principles necessary for life; and he never showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free from passion, and also most affectionate; and he  could express approbation without noisy display, and he possessed mu ch knowledge without ostentation.", "From Alexander the grammarian, to  refrain from fault-finding, and not in a reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous or solecistic or stra nge-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce the very expression which ought to have been used, and in the way of answer or giving confirmation, or  joining in an inquiry about the thing itself, not about the word, or by some other fit suggestion.", "From Fronto I learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy are in a tyrant, and that genera lly those among us who are called Patricians are rather defici ent in paternal affection.   ", "From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity to say to any one, or to write in a letter, that I have no leisure; nor continually to excuse the neglect  of duties required by our relation to those with whom we live, by alleging urgent occupations.", "From Catulus, not to be indifferent  when a friend finds fault, even if he should find fault without r eason, but to try to restore him to his usual disposition; and to be  ready to speak well of teachers, as it is reported of Domitius and Athenodotus; and to love my children truly. ", "From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice; and through him I lear ned to know Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion, Brutus; and from him I received the idea of a polity in which there is the same law for all,  a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed; I learned from him also consiste ncy and undeviating steadiness in my regard for philosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to give to others readily, and to cheris h good hopes, and to believe that I am loved by my friends; and in him I observed no concealment of his opinions with respect to those whom he condemned, and that his friends had no need to conjecture wh at he wished or did not wish, but it was quite plain. ", "From Maximus I learned self-govern ment, and not to be led aside by anything; and cheerfulness in all circ umstances, as well as in illness; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never had any bad intentio n; and he never showed amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; a nd he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right rath er than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, th at no man could ever think that he was despised by Maximus, or ever  venture to think himself a better man. He had also the art of bei ng humorous in an agreeable way.", "In my father I observed mildness of  temper, and unchangeable resolution in the things which he had determ ined after due deliberation; and no vainglory in those things whic h men call honours; and a love of labour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness ", "in giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived from experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission. And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more than any other citi zen; and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with hi m or to attend him of necessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed too his habit of careful inquiry in  all matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and that he neve r stopped his investigation through being satisfied with appearances wh ich first present themselves; and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired of them, nor yet to be ex travagant in his affection; and to be satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to  foresee things a long way off, and to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately popular applause and all flattery; a nd to be ever watchful over the things which were necessary for the administration of the empire, and to be a good manager of the e xpenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for such cond uct; and he was neither superstitious with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or by flattering th e populace; but he showed sobriety in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, nor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without arrogance and withou t excusing himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had them not, he did not want them. No  one could ever say of him that he was either a sophist or a home- bred flippant slave or a pedant; but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery, able to manage his own and other me n's affairs. Besides this, he honoured those who were true philosophers, an d he did not reproach those who pretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. He t ook a reasonable care of his body's health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's art or of medicine or external a pplications. He was most ready to give way without envy to those w ho possessed any particular faculty, such as that of eloquence or knowle dge of the law or of morals, or of anything else; and he gave them  his help, that each might enjoy reputation according to his deserts;  and he always acted conformably to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation of doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual o ccupations. His secrets were not ", "but very few and very rare, and th ese only about public matters; and he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles and the construction of public build ings, his donations to the people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be done, not to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not take the bath at unseasonable hours;  he was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, no r about the texture and colour of his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. Hi s dress came from Lorium, his villa on the coast, a nd from Lanuvium generally. We know how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon; and such was all his behaviour. Th ere was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he had abundance of time, and without conf usion, in an orderly way, vigorously and consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able bot h to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak  to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong en ough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perf ect and invincible soul, such as he showed in  the illness of Maximus. ", "To the gods I am indebted for ha ving good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associ ates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good. Further, I ow e it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them, though I had a disposition which, if opportunity had offered, mi ght have led me to do something of this kind; but, through their favour, there never was such a concurrence of circumstances as put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather's concubine, and that I preserved the flower of  my youth, and that I did not make proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was subjected to a ru ler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in such a man' s power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private pers on, without being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother, who was able by his moral character  to rouse me to vigilance over myself, and who, at the same time, pleas ed me by his respect and affection; that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more proficiency in rh etoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to place those ", "who brought me up in the station of honour, which they seemed to desire, without putting them off with hope of my doing it some time after, because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus; that I received clear a nd frequent impressions about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so far as depended on the gods, and thei r gifts, and help, and inspirations, nothing hindered me from forthwith  living according to nature, though I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may al most say, their dir ect instructions; that my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into amatory passions, I was cure d; and, though I was often out of humour with Rusticus, I never di d anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any man in his need, or  on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the same necessity never happened, to r eceive anything from another; that I have such a wife, so obedient, a nd so affectionate, and so simple; that I had abundance of good masters fo r my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and ag ainst bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclinat ion to philosophy, I did not fall into the hands of a ny sophist, and that  I did not waste my time on writers of histories, or  in the resoluti on of syllogisms, or occupy myself about the investigat ion of appearances in the heavens; for all these things require th e help of the gods and fortune.", "Among the Quadi at the Granua. ", "------------------------------------ ----------------- -----------------", "BOOK TWO", "Begin the morning by saying to thysel f, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful , envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of  their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the natu re of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, a nd the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be  angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for co-ope ration, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the uppe r and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to na ture; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.  ", " Whatever this is that I am, it is  a little flesh and breath, and the ruling part. Throw away thy books; no longer distract thyself: it is not allowed; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh; it is blood and bones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins, and arteries. See the breath also, what kind of a thing it is, air, and not always the same, but every moment sent out and again sucked in. The third then is the ruling part: consider thus: Thou art an old man; no longer let this be a slave, no longer be pulled by the strings like a puppet to unsocial moveme nts, no longer either be dissatisfied with thy present lot, or shrink from the future. ", "All that is from the gods is full of Providence. That which is from fortune is not separated from natu re or without an interweaving and involution with the things which ar e ordered by Providence. From thence all things flow; and there is besides necessity, and that which is for the advantage of the whole uni verse, of which thou art a part. But that is good for every part of  nature which the nature of the whole brings, and what serves to ma intain this nature. Now the universe is preserved, as by the changes of the elements so by the changes of things compounded of the elemen ts. Let these principles be enough for thee, let them always be fixed opinions. But cast away the thirst after books, that thou mayest not di e murmuring, but cheerfully, truly, and from thy heart than kful to the gods. ", "Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return. ", "Every moment think steadily as a Roman and a man to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice; and to gi ve thyself relief from all other thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the co mmands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and self-love, and discontent with  the portion which has been given to thee. Thou seest how few the things are, the which if a man lays hold of, he is able to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like the existence of the gods; for the gods on their part will require nothing more from him who observes these things. ", "Do wrong to thyself, do wrong to th yself, my soul; but thou wilt no ", "longer have the opportunity of honour ing thyself. Every man's life is sufficient. But thine is nearly finished, though thy soul reverences not itself but places thy felicity  in the souls of others.", "Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around. But then thou must also avoid be ing carried about the other way. For those too are triflers who have w earied themselves in life by their activity, and yet have no object to which to direct every movement, and, in a word, all their thoughts. ", "Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has seldom been seen to be unhappy; but those who do not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy. ", "This thou must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole, and what is my nature, and how this  is related to that, and what kind of a part it is of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one who hinders thee from always doing and saying the things which are according to the nature of which thou art a part. ", "Theophrastus, in his comparison of bad acts- such a comparison as one would make in accordance with the common notions of mankind- says, like a true philosopher, that the offences which are committed through desire are more blameable than t hose which are committed through anger. For he who is excited by anger seem s to turn away from reason with a certain pain and unconscious contraction; but he who offends through desire, being overpowered by pleasure, seems to be in a manner more intemperate and more womanish in his offences. Rightly then, and in a way worthy of philosophy, he said that the offence which is committed with pleasure is more blameable than that which is committed with pain; and on the whole the one is more like a person who has been first wronged and through pain is comp elled to be angry; but the other is moved by his own impulse to do wrong, being carried towards doing something by desire. ", "Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among men, if there are gods, is not a thi ng to be afraid of, for the gods will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have no concern about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or de void of Providence? But in truth they do exist, and they do care for human things, and they have put all the means in man's power to enable  him not to fall into real evils. And as to the rest, if there was a nything evil, they would have provided for this also, that it should be altogether in a man's power not to ", "fall into it. Now that which does not make a man worse, how can it make a man's life worse? But neith er through ignorance, nor having the knowledge, but not the power to  guard against or correct these things, is it possible that the na ture of the universe has overlooked them; nor is it possible that it has made so great a mistake, either through want of power or want of  skill, that good and evil should happen indiscriminately to the good and the bad. But death certainly, and life, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, all these things equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither better nor worse. Therefore th ey are neither good nor evil.", "How quickly all things disappear, in  the universe the bodies themselves, but in time the remembrance of them; what is the nature of all sensible things, and particularly those whic h attract with the bait of pleasure or terrify by pain, or are noised ab road by vapoury fame; how worthless, and contemptible, and sordid, and pe rishable, and dead they are- all this it is the part of the intell ectual faculty to observe. To observe too who these are whose opinions an d voices give reputation; what death is, and the fact that, if a man looks at it in itself, and by the abstractive power of reflecti on resolves into their parts all the things which present themselves to the imagination in it, he will then consider it to be nothing else  than an operation of nature; and if any one is afraid of an operati on of nature, he is a child. This, however, is not only an operation of  nature, but it is also a thing which conduces to the purposes of na ture. To observe too how man comes near to the deity, and by what part of him, and when this part of man is so disposed. ", "Nothing is more wretched than a man who traverses everything in a round, and pries into the things be neath the earth, as the poet says, and seeks by conjecture what is in  the minds of his neighbours, without perceiving that it is sufficient to  attend to the da emon within him, and to reverence it sincerely. And reverence of the daemon consists in keeping it pure from passion a nd thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction with what comes from gods and men. For the things from the gods merit veneration for their excellence; and the things from men should be dear to us by reason of kinship; and sometimes even, in a manner, they move our pity by reason of me n's ignorance of good and bad; this defect being not less than that wh ich deprives us of the power of distinguishing things that  are white and black. ", "Though thou shouldst be going to live three thousand years, and as many times ten thousand years, still remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses. The longest and shortest are thus brought to the same. For the present is th e same to all, though that which ", "perishes is not the same; and so that which is lost appears to be a mere moment. For a man cannot lose  either the past or the future: for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him? These two things then thou must bear in mind; the one, that all things from eternity are of like forms and co me round in a circle, and that it makes no difference whether a man shall see the same things during a hundred years or two hundred, or an  infinite time; and the second, that the longest liver and he who w ill die soonest lose just the same. For the present is the only thing of which a man can be deprived, if it is true that this is the onl y thing which he has, and that a man cannot lose a thing if he has it not. ", "Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Monimus is manifest: and manifest too is th e use of what was said, if a man receives what may be got out of it as far as it is true.", "The soul of man does violence to itse lf, first of all, when it becomes an abscess and, as it were, a tum our on the universe, so far as it can. For to be vexed at anything wh ich happens is a separation of ourselves from nature, in some part of which the natures of all other things are contained. In the next pl ace, the soul does violence to itself when it turns away from any man, or even moves towards him with the intention of injuring, such as are th e souls of those who are angry. In the third place, the so ul does violence to itself when it is overpowered by pleasure or by  pain. Fourthly, when it plays a part, and does or says anythi ng insincerely and untruly. Fifthly, when it allows any act of its own and any movement to be without an aim, and does anything thoughtlessly  and without considering what it is, it being right that even the smal lest things be done with reference to an end; and the end of rationa l animals is to follow the reason and the law of the most ancient city and polity. ", "Of human life the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the perception dull, and the co mposition of the whole body subject to putrefaction, and the soul a whir l, and fortune hard to divine, and fame a thing devoid of judgement. And, to say all in a word, everything which belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul is a dream and vapour, and life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion. What then is that which is  able to conduct a man? One thing and only one, philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing  without purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man's doing or not doing anything; and be sides, accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, ", "as being nothing else than a disso lution of the elements of which every living being is compounded. But if there is no harm to the elements themselves in each continually changing into another, why should a man have any apprehension about th e change and dissolution of all the elements?

For if he shall begin to fall into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and imagination and appetite, and whatever else there is of the kind, will not fail; but the power of making use of ourselves, and filling up the measure of our duty, and clearly separating all appearances, and considering whether a man should now depart from  life, and whatever else of the kind absolutely requires a discip lined reason, all th is is already extinguished. We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first. ", "We ought to observe also that even the things which follow after the things which are produced according to nature contain something pleasing and attractive. For instance, when br ead is baked some parts are split at the surface, and these parts wh ich thus open, and have a certain fashion contrary to the purpose of  the baker's art, are beautiful in a manner, and in a peculiar wa y excite a desire for eating. And again, figs, when they are quite ri pe, gape open; and in the ripe olives the very circumstance of th eir being near to rottenness adds a peculiar beauty to the fruit. And the ears of corn bending down, and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of wild boars, and many other things - though they are far from being beautiful, if a man should examine them severally- still, because they are consequent upon the things  which are formed by nature, help to adorn them, and they please the mi nd; so that if a man should have a feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are produced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner ", "disposed so as to give pleasure. And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than those which painters and sculptors show by im itation; and in an old woman and an old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to look on with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves, not pleasing to every man, but to him only who has become truly familiar with nature and her works.

Alexander, and Pompeius, and Caiu s Caesar, after so often completely destroying whole cities, and in ba ttle cutting to pieces many ten thousands of cavalry and infantry, themselves too at last departed from life. Heraclitus, after so many speculations on the conflagration of the universe, was filled with water internally and died smeared all over with mud. And li ce destroyed Democritus; and other lice killed Socrates. What means all this? Thou hast embarked, thou hast made the voyage, thou art come to shore; get out. If indeed to another life, there is no want of gods, not even there. But if to a state without sensation, thou wilt cease to  be held by pains and pleasures, and to be a slave to the vessel, which is as much inferior as that which serves it is superior: for the one is intelligence and deity; the other is earth and corruption.

For thou losest the opportunity of doing something else when thou hast such thoughts as these, What is such a person doing, and why, and what is he saying, and what is  he thinking of, and what is he contriving, and whatever else of the kind makes us wander away from the observation of our own ruling power. We ought then to check in the series of our t houghts everything that is without a purpose and useless, but most of all the over- curious feeling and the malignant; and a man should use himself to think of those things only about which if one should suddenly ask, What hast thou now in thy thoughts? With perfect openness thou mightest, imme diately answer, This or That; so that from thy words it should be  plain that everything in thee is simple and benevolent, and such  as befits a social animal, and one that cares not for thoughts about  pleasure or sensual enjoyments at all, nor has any rivalry or e nvy and suspicion, or anything else for which thou wouldst blush if t hou shouldst say that thou hadst it in thy mind.

For it is only what belongs to himself that he makes the matter for his activity; and he constantly thinks of that which is allotted to himself out of the sum total of things, and he makes his own acts fair, and he is persuaded that his own portion is good. For the lot which is assigned to each man is carried along with him and carries him along with it. And he re members also that every rational animal is his kinsman, and that to care for all men is according to man's nature; and a man should hold on to the opinion not of all, but of those only who confessedly live according to nature. But as to those who live not so, he always bears in mind what kind of men they are both at home and from home, both by night and by day, and what they are, and with what men th ey live an impure life.

For in  the first case Prescribed means something like this: he prescribed this for this man as a thing adapted ", "to procure health; and in the second case it means: That which happens to (or, suits) every man is fixe d in a manner for him suitably to his destiny. For this is what we m ean when we say that things are suitable to us, as the workmen say of  squared stones in walls or the pyramids, that they are suitable, when they fit them to one another in some kind of connexion.

For he would not have brought on an y man what he has brought, if it were not useful for the whole. Neither does the nature of anything, whatever it may be, cause  anything which is not suitable to that which is directed by it. For two reasons  then it is right to be content with that which happens to thee ; the one, because it was done for thee and prescribed for thee, and in a manner had reference to thee, originally from the most ancient causes spun with thy destiny; and the other, because even that whic h comes severally to every man is to the power which administers the universe a cause of felicity and perfection, nay even of its very c ontinuance.
